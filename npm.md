# NPM Packages

## Background Motivations

From time to time, I find myself coding the same algorithms and functions again and again for different projects. For example, calendar generation of mobile components, handling and computing mathematical expressions for calculators. So I went ahead and made some NPM Packages, which are well documented, and released them for personal and also public use.
