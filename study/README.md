# Academics

This section of the website is dedicated to documenting my academic work. There will be 3 subsections to this portion of the documentation: **Bachelor's**, **Master's**, and **PhD**. Each section will highlight the dissertation/thesis of the degree.

Below, I will highlight the nature and the subjects of each degree as well as provide detailed grades for each module.

## [BSc Computer Science](./bsc.md)

This is a taught undergraduate degree. The degree focuses on the basics of computer science and programming. The program is a 3-year degree and 2 semesters per year. There are 7 modules taught each year, 3 in each semester and one spanning across 2 semesters. The [final year project (dissertation)]("./bsc.md) is done in the third year, spanning the entire year.

## [MRes Aritificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](./mres.md)

This is a research master's degree, which means that the nature of this degree primarily surrounds researching on one specific topic/project and students are graded heavily on their research efforts. Two-thirds of the final grade is weighted towards the [year-long research project (thesis)]("./mres.md), with the remaining percentages equally distributed to subsidiary modules and course assignments.
